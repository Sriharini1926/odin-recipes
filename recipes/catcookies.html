   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour (150g, $0.39)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp cocoa powder ($0.12)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp black cocoa powder ($0.24)</li>
    <li>½ tsp baking soda ($0.01)</li>
    <li>¼ tsp salt ($0.01)</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2-4 tablespoons of milk</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Procedure</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the dry ingredients: all-purpose flour, cocoa powders, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a stand mixer using the paddle attachment (can alternatively use hand mixer or whisk), mix the butter and sugars on medium speed until combined. Scrape bottom of bowl. Add vanilla and mix again.</li>
    <li>Dump in all of the dry ingredients and mix until combined. If the dough is crumbly, slowly add 2-4 tbsp of dairy-free milk until it comes together. The finished dough should be thick.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F/177°C and line two baking trays with parchment paper or silicone mats.</li>
    <li>Use small cookie dough scoop to gather dough (about 1 ½ tablespoon each). Shape dough into ball, then place onto lined baking tray. Flatten with palm of your hand or bottom of a cup. This will be the cat's head.
       For the ears, take ½ tsp of dough and shape into a triangle with your fingers Place the ear on the upper left or right side of the head and repeat for the other ear. Place cats about 3-4 inches apart. They will not spread much while baking</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-13 minutes. Cookies should look slightly puffy and soft in the center with set edges. They will not brown because of their black color.</li>
